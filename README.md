# 🏗️ Construction Escrow Protocol

## 🌐 Overview

The **Construction Escrow Program** is a Solana smart contract built with the Anchor framework.  
It manages escrow accounts between **buyers** and **sellers** of construction materials, ensuring funds are only released after verified delivery.  

It supports **milestones**, **multi-oracle verification**, **time-locks**, **retention (holdbacks)**, **NFT receipts**, and **dispute resolution**.  
A comprehensive TypeScript test suite is included to demonstrate account setup, PDA derivation, and step-by-step validation.

> **Note:** This project was developed as a **proof of concept** for a client researching how **construction escrow systems** could be implemented on blockchain, specifically leveraging the **Solana ecosystem**. The goal was to explore transparency, automation, and trustless settlement for large-scale material contracts.
